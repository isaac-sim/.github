<p align="justify">Welcome to NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a fully extensible, reference application enabling developers to design, simulate, test, and train AI-based robots and autonomous machines, and generate synthetic data.</p>

 <p align="justify">The core functionality of Isaac Sim is GPU-accelerated multi-physics simulation, based on NVIDIAPhysX, and RTX technology for physically-accurate simulation of sensors including cameras and LiDARs. </p>

 <p align="justify">Isaac Sim provides a suite of technologies for robotics use cases, including ROS 2 bridges for testing robot software stacks, Isaac Lab for training RL agents and Replicator for generating synthetic data.</p>
